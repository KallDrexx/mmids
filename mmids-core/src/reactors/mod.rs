//! Reactors are actors that are used to manage workflows for specific stream names. This is a
//! pull mechanism for dynamic workflow capabilities in mmids. When a reactor is asked for a
//! workflow for a stream name, the reactor will reach out to an external service (configured
//! by a reactor executor) to obtain a workflow definition for the requested stream name. If none
//! is returned then that normally means the stream name is not allowed. If a valid workflow
//! definition is returned, the reactor will ensure that the workflow is created so media can be
//! routed to it.
