/// the beginning of a workflow it will be given a unique stream identifier, and it will keep that
/// identifier until it leaves the last stage of the workflow.  This allows for logging to give
/// visibility of how media is processed throughout it's all lifetime.
///
/// If a workflow has a step that requires media to leave the system and then come back in for
/// further steps, than it should keep the same stream identifier.  For example, if
/// a workflow has an ffmpeg transcoding step in the workflow (e.g. to add a watermark), when
/// ffmpeg pushes the video back in it will keep the same identifier.
